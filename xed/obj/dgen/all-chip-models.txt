# This file is for defining sets of extensions implemented by various chips
#
# The first column is a chip name. It will become the source for the enum xed_chip_t XED_CHIP_*
# The rest of the columns are ISA extensions that that CHIP implements
# ALL_OF(x) is a macro that refers to the set defined previously for some chip x.
# NOT(y) is a macro that removes a specific ISA extension (processed last)
